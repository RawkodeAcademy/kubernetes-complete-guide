Namespace: N/A, Linkerd is cool

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication. Itâ€™s responsible for the reliable delivery of requests through the complex topology of services that comprise a modern, cloud native application. These service meshes are transparent to both the application code and the infrastructure that runs the application, giving developers the end-to-end visibility and control they need to keep services safe and fast.
