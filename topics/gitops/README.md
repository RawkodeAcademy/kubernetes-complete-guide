# GitOps

From: WeaveWorks

GitOps is a way to do Kubernetes application delivery. It works by using Git as a single source of truth for Kubernetes resources and everything else. With Git at the center of your delivery pipelines, you and your team can make pull requests to accelerate and simplify application deployments and operations tasks to Kubernetes.
