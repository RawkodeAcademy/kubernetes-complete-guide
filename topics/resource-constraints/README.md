# Resource Requests and Limits

Namespace: N/A, pod level configuration

Resource requests and limits are a way to control the amount of resources a pod can consume. This is important because if a pod consumes too many resources, it can cause the node to become unstable and crash. This is also important because if a pod does not consume enough resources, it can cause the pod to be evicted from the node.
