# Helm

From: Microsoft / CNCF

Helm is a tool to help you define, install, and upgrade applications running on Kubernetes. At its most basic, Helm is a templating engine that creates Kubernetes manifests. What makes Helm more than that is it can upgrade and scale applications as well.

Helm is mostly for 3rd party applications, though many organisations rely on Helm as a way to package their own applications.
